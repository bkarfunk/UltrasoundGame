## Top of the To Do List

- Format everything so it looks pleasant
- Create a username system for the testing portion
- Create and store a record of results for the testing portion (and maybe include which questions they did)
- Add more images and maps (need at least 30)
  * Once we have a lot of images, make the test 15-20 random questions with half normal half abnormal
  * For each image we may need a different scale setting for measurements
- Consider Change the testing component question to have check-boxes of "Normal vs abnormal, thick wall vs no thick wall, dilated cbd vs no dilated cbd, stone vs no stone" or "technically limited can not evaluate"?
- maybe add explanations to the questions?
- For the testing component, can the image map overlay be set to not show up when moused over, only if clicked?
